**descreption**
This project represent a Polynom and a Monom when each of them has functions that can be applied on them.
<Monom class>
This class represent a Monom from the format a*X^b (a is a decimal number that represent the coefficient and b is a natural number, not negative, that represent the power),
and functions that perform actions on the Monom as: add, muliyply, derivative, f(x) and toString.
<Polynom class>
This class represent a Polynom from the format a*X1^b + a*X2^b + a*X3^b + .... + a*Xn^b 
and functions that perform actions on the Polynom as: add, muliyply, derivative, f(x), substract, equals, isZero, root, copy, area, Iterator and toString.
